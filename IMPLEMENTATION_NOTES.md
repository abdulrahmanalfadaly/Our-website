# Flexi OSSD Challenge - Implementation Notes

## Mascot Emotion System

The mascot changes emotions based on student performance:

### Emotion States:
- **`flexi_teaching.png`** - Shows when presenting a new question
- **`flexi_sad.png`** - Shows after 1st wrong attempt  
- **`flexi_thinking.png`** - Shows after 2nd+ wrong attempts
- **`flexi_happy.png`** - Shows when answer is correct
- **`flexi_clap.png`** - Shows when grade is finished

### Implementation Pattern (Grade 1 - COMPLETE ✅):

```javascript
// 1. Use correctAnswersRef object (not primitive)
let correctAnswersRef = {count: 0};

// 2. Reset attempts at start of each question
function showQuestion(){
    resetAttempts();
    changeMascot(MASCOT.teaching, q.instruction || q.question);
    // ... render question
}

// 3. Use universal handlers
createMultipleChoiceHandler(q, correctAnswersRef, nextQuestion)
createFillBlankHandler(q, correctAnswersRef, nextQuestion)  
createMatchingHandler(q, correctAnswersRef, nextQuestion)

// 4. Use .count when displaying score
levelInstructions.textContent = `You got ${correctAnswersRef.count} out of ${questions.length} correct!`;
```

### Grades Status:
- ✅ Grade 1: Complete with full emotion system
- ⏳ Grades 2-12: Need to apply same pattern

### To Apply to Remaining Grades:
1. Change `let correctAnswers = 0` to `let correctAnswersRef = {count: 0}`
2. Add `resetAttempts()` at start of `showQuestion()`
3. Add `changeMascot(MASCOT.teaching, ...)` when showing questions
4. Replace manual handlers with `createXHandler()` functions
5. Update all `correctAnswers` references to `correctAnswersRef.count`
